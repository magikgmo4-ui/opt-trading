Okay, I need to figure out how to respond to this user's query. They've provided a task where they want me to act as the assistant called ROADMAP, which means I should be thinking of things like "think," "analyze," etc., and explain everything in French.

First, looking at the data, there are two events on 2026-02-26T17:10. The first one is a "Patch UI" event with message "Added commands section + fixed HEAD 405." I should note that they're adding a commands section and fixing a HEAD error.

The second event is at the same time, but it's about adding scoring rule functionality. They mention macro score weighting and updating tests. Also, there's an internal test being pushed to the student registry.

I need to structure this into sections: Hypothèses (Hypotheses), Analyse des événements (Analysis of Events), Ce qui manque (What is Missing?), Plan détaillé (Detailed Plan), Risques (Risks), Tests/validation (Validations and Testing).

In the Hypotheses section, I should explain that they're adding features related to UI patches. In analyzing events, I'll mention each specific action: commands section addition, scoring rule message, test push.

What is Missing? They have two new tasks added but didn't add a third feature yet.

Plan détaillé will outline the steps and priorities. First, handle the patches in order, then validate before pushing any tests.

Risks include potential issues with the UI or data validation in previous events.

Testing is their plan to push an internal test to the student registry.

I should make sure each section is clear and concise, following the user's thought process example. Also, use proper French language while explaining each part step by step.
