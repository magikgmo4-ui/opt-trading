Alright, so the user wants me to explain how I approached answering their question about a French translation of some system events. They provided specific JSON data with two events related to a module named 'desk_pro'. 

First, I need to understand what exactly they're asking for. It seems like they want me to think through each event step by step, breaking down the translation into understandable sections. They also mentioned using markdown formatting and structuring the response as per their given sections: Hypothèses, Analyse des événements, Ce qui manque, Plan détaillé, Risques, Tests/validation, etModule: desk_pro, N_EVENTS: 20.

Okay, let me start by outlining each section. Under Hypothèses, I should define what the main goal is—translating two specific events from English to French. The Analysis of Events will be about looking at both events individually and then together. The "Ce qui manque" part refers to missing information, so I need to address any gaps in understanding.

Then, under Plan détaillé, I'll structure the response with each event first and then a combined overview. Risques and Tests/validation (Risks and Validation) will cover potential issues and testing methods. Finally, under Module: desk_pro, I'll specify that it's about this module for translation.

For each event, I'll take them one by one. The first event is a patch UI with commands section + fixed HEAD 405. I'll explain how to translate the translation points into French, ensuring that technical terms are correctly used in a business context. The second event involves adding scoring rule, macro score weighting, and updating tests. Here, I'll focus on translating each action clearly, explaining why specific phrases were chosen—like 'macro score weighting' as 'weightage des scores macro'.

I need to make sure my translation is accurate, especially since the events are technical. I should consider any jargon or domain-specific terms that might not translate well but explain their meaning in context.

Throughout this process, I'll use markdown formatting to structure each section neatly, making it easy for the user to follow as they read through each part step by step.
